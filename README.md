# pasc500-compiler-in-C-language

This is my first major project for Compilers in Computer Science. I would like to give my thanks to the other 2 fellow students (besties) who helped me complete this.

1) Vouklis Marios Nikolaos.

2) Kozanis Konstantinos.

3) Katounis Emmanouil Ioannis (me).


Compile: 1) flex compiler.l
         2) gcc lex.yy.c -lm
         3) ./a.out name_test.p
